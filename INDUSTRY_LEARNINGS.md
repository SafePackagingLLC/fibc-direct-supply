- **Materials**: PP/PE/PET pellets, regrind flakes, post-consumer plastics
- **Processing**: Collected → Sorted by resin → Shredded/ground → Washed → Melted → Extruded into pellets
- **Contamination concern**: Chemical contamination in recycled pellets, mixed resin types degrade quality
- **Bag requirements**: Baffle bags for pelletized products (better stacking), duffle top for loose scrap

#### Metal Recycling
- **Ferrous metals**: Steel, iron, cast iron (magnetic, lower value: $150-300/ton)
- **Non-ferrous metals**: Aluminum, copper, brass, zinc (non-magnetic, higher value: copper $3-4/lb)
- **Processing**: Collected → Sorted (magnet test) → Shredded → Separated → Melted into ingots
- **Bag requirements**: Heavy-duty construction, puncture-resistant for sharp shredded edges

#### Textile & Clothing Recycling
- **Categories**: 45% resold as secondhand apparel, 30% wiping/polishing cloths, 20% reprocessed fiber, 5% waste
- **Grading system**: Up to 253 specific grades based on quality, category, seasonality, material
- **End products**: Insulation (denim), furniture stuffing, automotive soundproofing, carpet padding
- **Bag requirements**: Ventilated for moisture control, large capacity for bulky materials

#### E-Waste / Electronics Recycling
- **Components**: Circuit boards (PCBs), shredded WEEE, precious metal concentrates
- **Precious metals**: Gold, silver, copper, palladium, platinum recoverable from circuit boards
- **Processing**: Collected → Shredded → Magnetically separated → Eddy current separation → Smelting
- **Bag requirements**: Antistatic (Type B/C) for sensitive components, puncture protection

### Key Certifications & Standards

#### R2 (Responsible Recycling)
- Created by Sustainable Electronics Recycling International (SERI)
- Covers environmental/health criteria, worker safety, data security, toxic material supervision
- Requires ISO 14001 or RIOS environmental management system
- EPA-recognized certification for electronics recyclers

#### e-Stewards
- Created by Basel Action Network (BAN) in 2009
- Stricter standard: No hazardous e-waste export to developing nations
- Requires ISO 14001 and NAID AAA certification
- Prohibits forced or child labor in recycling chain

#### ISO 14001
- International environmental management system standard
- Required foundation for both R2 and e-Stewards certification
- Covers environmental policy, planning, implementation, monitoring

#### ISRI Specifications
- Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries grading standards
- Defines grades for scrap metal, paper, plastic, electronics, textiles
- Example: OCC 11 (Old Corrugated Cardboard Grade 11)

### Best Practices for Recycling FIBCs

#### Bag Selection
- Match bag type to material: baffle for pellets, ventilated for textiles, heavy-duty for metals
- Use 6:1 SFR bags for multi-trip operations to maximize cost efficiency
- Color-code bags by material stream to prevent cross-contamination

#### Reuse Guidelines
- Reuse only within "closed loop" systems (same product, same application)
- Inspect bags before each use: check lift loops, seams, fabric integrity
- Clean and recondition bags between uses per FIBCA guidelines
- Replace bags showing signs of wear, tears, or weakened lift loops

#### Storage & Handling
- Store empty bags in clean, dry areas
- Keep different material stream bags separated
- Document bag usage cycles to track remaining lifespan
- Train operators on proper filling and lifting procedures
